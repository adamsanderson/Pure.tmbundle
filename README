This is a TextMate bundle for the Pure language (http://code.google.com/p/pure-lang/).

Beware of the following:
1. I do not really know Pure
2. The syntax is not exactly right, I am taking some liberties to make it look good...
3. I assume pure is installed via MacPorts in /opt/local/lib/pure

The prior disclaimer aside, this should support a simple syntax for Pure,
and a couple of useful commands. The help function (ctrl-h) is actually pretty 
good, give it a try on anything documented in the pure library.

Forks and contributions would be greatly appreciated.
